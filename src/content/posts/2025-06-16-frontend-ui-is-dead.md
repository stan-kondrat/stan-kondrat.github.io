title: Frontend UI is dead - welcome Voice User Interface (VUI) AI Agent
categories: Thoughts
tags: AI MCP
excerpt: Any tasks you can delegate to a human assistant will be delegated to a Voice-controlled AI Agent.

This post isn’t about how you can generate a Photoshop design with prompts, or how Figma can generate code — or even spin up a full Wix site from a single prompt.

**Frontend UI, quite literally, is becoming mostly unnecessary**. Only a small fraction of specialized UIs for professionals will remain.

> Any tasks you can delegate to a human assistant will be delegated to a Voice-controlled AI Agent.

### Get Started Now!

And most importantly, **this is already possible today**:

- Keep your current backend API.
- Add an GraphQL or REST MCP server.
- Use Claude Desktop MCP or VS Code Voice for testing.
- Connect Vapi.ai, Claude.ai and ChatGPT soon.
- Done.

**The end user gets voice control over your service using your existing backend API.**

### Predictions

1. New SaaS products will be frontless — only **backends with MCP connectors**, like Zapier MCP. UI Frontend will be generated only as a fallback.
2. All existing SaaS APIs will add an MCP layer on top of their current backends.

PS: The Siri 2.0 plan is to use AI control over the existing UI. MCP includes more metadata you can provide, such as common prompts.

PPS: Currently, MCP is used primarily by developers, such as in Cursor or Copilot. The natural next step is enabling end users to interact with APIs through MCP and voice control.
