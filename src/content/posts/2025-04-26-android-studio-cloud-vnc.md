title: Android Studio Cloud… is just VNC. Seriously?

excerpt: It’s basically just a browser-based VNC connection to a Linux machine.

Just found out about [Android Studio Cloud](https://studio.firebase.google.com/new/android-studio). At first, I thought: “Nice, maybe they made a VS Code-style cloud IDE and finally moved away from heavy JetBrains stuff.” That would make sense.
But nope.

They just set up a Linux machine, installed Android Studio, and gave you VNC access. That’s it. That’s the whole "cloud" experience.

It’s slow, clunky, and feels like a remote desktop from 2000. No cloud magic, no lightweight IDE, nothing.

Classic example of a big company where the only priority is to ship something — no matter how clunky it is.
