excerpt: How software development has changed based on my 20 years of experience.

After 20 years as a software developer, here’s a small note based on my experience about how software development has changed.

**Before 2010** - things were pretty old-school and quite archaic. We uploaded builds manually via FTP, there was almost no automation, and most processes were just made up as we went.

**2010–2020** - everything became more structured. Source control became a must, CI/CD pipelines appeared, we got proper dev/prod environments, code reviews became standard practice (for me, this was thanks to the Redmine Code Review plugin), frameworks, and Agile, Scrum, TDD, BDD and other abbreviations.

**Now** - AI (LLMs) has entered the scene.
AI writes most of the code, and developers focus on creating clear specs and good prompts.
Once the AI generates the code, we check and polish each line - this is now called **Vibe Cleaning**.

And one last thing: the old levels - Junior, Middle, Senior - don’t really matter anymore.
