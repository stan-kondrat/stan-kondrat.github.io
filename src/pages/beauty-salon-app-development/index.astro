          <li>
            <strong>Read FAQ & Agreements</strong><br />Start by reviewing the
            FAQ section and agreement terms to understand the process clearly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Make Payment</strong><br />Secure your project by making the
            payment directly to me, Stan.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fill Out Your Salon Details</strong><br />Provide your
            company information, photos, services, staff details, and anything
            you want included in your app.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Create Developer Accounts</strong><br />Set up Apple and
            Google developer accounts under your salon’s name.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Share Developer Access</strong><br />Grant me developer
            access so I can publish your app.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Test & Review</strong><br />I’ll upload your app to
            TestFlight (iOS) and private testing (Android) so you can review and
            provide feedback.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Launch & Share</strong><br />Once approved, your app goes

          get in touch. Unlike many other developers who leave you on your own
          after delivery, I’m committed to guiding you through every step—from
          understanding the agreements to launching and beyond. Your success is
          my priority, and I’m always available to clarify, assist, and ensure
          you feel confident with your new branded salon app.

              Agencies can be very expensive and slow, often with complicated
              processes that drag out your project and inflate costs. They
